**Internal Linking of Related Contents** allows you to automatically insert inline related posts within your WordPress articles.

== Description ==

**Internal Linking of Related Contents** allows you to automatically insert inline related posts within your WordPress articles, based on categories or post tags.

Internal Linking is a powerful SEO technique and an important tool to increase your page views. Moreover, it helps reduce the bounce rate.

With our plugin, you can insert inline similar posts within your WordPress articles, rather than at the end of the post content, like the most popular plugins.
